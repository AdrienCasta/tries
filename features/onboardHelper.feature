Feature: Onboarding a new helper
  As an admin
  I want to onboard qualified users as helpers
  So that they can access the platform and start applaying to events

  Background:
    Given the admin is authenticated

  # Rule: Helper information must be valid and complete

  @unit
  Scenario Outline: Admin onboards a qualified helper
    Given an admin has a qualified helper's information
    When the admin submits the onboarding request for "<firstname>" "<lastname>"
    Then a helper account is created for "<email>"
    And a welcome email is sent to "<email>"
    And the helper can access the Tries platform

    Examples:
      | email                    | firstname  | lastname |
      | john@doe.com             | John       | Doe      |
      | helper@example.com       | John       | Smith    |
      | francois@paris.fr        | Fran√ßois   | Dubois   |

  @e2e
  Scenario Outline: Admin cannot onboard a helper with duplicate email
    Given a helper "<firstname>" "<lastname>" with email "<email>" is already onboarded
    When an admin attempts to onboard a user with the same email
    Then the system rejects the request because <error>
    And the helper is not duplicated
    And no notification is sent

    Examples: Duplicate helper
      | email           | firstname | lastname | error                                 |
      | john@domain.com | John      | Doe      | this email address is already in use. |
      | john@domain.com | John      | Doe      | this email address is already in use. |
